# Cline Configuration for Plotify

## Coding Standards

- **Language**: All code, comments, documentation, and commit messages must be in English
- **Variables & Functions**: Use English names for variables, functions, classes, and files
- **Error Messages**: All error messages and logs in English
- **Documentation**: All .md files, inline docs, and code comments in English
- **Git**: Commit messages, branch names, and PR descriptions in English
- **User Interface**: Initial development in English (i18n will handle translations for end-users)

## Development Workflow

- Cline helps write and review code changes
- All code follows TypeScript and ESLint standards
- Vercel automatically deploys from main branch
- Database migrations must be reviewed by Cline before execution

## Database Migrations

Prisma migrations should:

- Use descriptive names with timestamps
- Be reviewed by Cline before execution
- Follow Prisma migration conventions
- Include proper rollback considerations
- Example: `20240101000000_create_users_table`

## Token Optimization

### Division of Responsibilities

- **Cline**: Focus on creating/modifying files only
- **User**: Execute all CLI commands (npm install, npx, git, etc.)
- **Cline**: Provide specific CLI commands to execute
- **User**: Confirm execution with minimal feedback (✅/❌ + brief description)

### Communication Efficiency

- Use specific, direct prompts
- Group related tasks in single requests
- Batch related files when logical
- Use established abbreviations (i18n, CRUD, etc.)
- Avoid redundant explanations of known concepts

### Standard Communication Format

```
Task: [concise description]
Files: [list of files to create/modify]
CLI Commands: [commands for user to execute]
Status: [✅/❌ + brief description]
Next: [next step]
```

### Confirmation Protocol

- ✅ Success: Brief confirmation only
- ❌ Error: Error message + specific issue
- No need for command output unless error occurs
- No need to use read commands (cat, ls) - Cline has file access

## Security Restrictions

DO NOT read or modify:

- .env files
- Any file containing API keys or credentials
- Database connection strings
- Authentication secrets
