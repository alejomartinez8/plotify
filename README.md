# Plotify - AI-Powered Community Management System

A comprehensive management system for residential plot communities, built as an exploration of cutting-edge AI development tools. This project demonstrates how modern AI assistants like Claude Code and Cline can accelerate development while maintaining production-quality code for real-world community financial management.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project serves as both a practical application and an exploration laboratory for AI-powered development:

1. **AI Development Tools Research**  
   As a senior developer, I'm actively experimenting with cutting-edge AI coding assistants to understand their capabilities, limitations, and impact on development workflows:
   - **Cline**: AI software engineer assistant for autonomous coding
   - **Claude Code**: Anthropic's official CLI for development assistance
   - **AI-Driven Development**: Exploring how AI can accelerate development, improve code quality, and handle complex refactoring

2. **Production-Grade Implementation**  
   While serving as an AI tools testbed, this application maintains enterprise-level standards with real functionality for community management. Every feature is built to production quality, demonstrating how AI assistance can create valuable, maintainable software.

3. **Learning & Documentation**  
   Documenting the experience of building with AI tools, comparing different approaches, and sharing insights about the future of AI-assisted development.
