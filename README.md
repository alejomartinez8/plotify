# Plotify - Community Plot Management System

A comprehensive management system for residential plot communities, designed to efficiently handle maintenance fees, improvement contributions, and expense tracking with full transparency and accountability.

## üéØ Project Goals

This project serves two primary objectives:

1. **IA Tool Exploration**  
   As a senior developer, I'm actively experimenting with next-generation AI development tools like:
   - Cline (AI software engineer assistant)
   - Claude Sonnet/Opus models
   - AI-powered development workflows
   - Emerging code generation paradigms

2. **Real-World Implementation**  
   While serving as a testbed for AI tools, the application maintains:
   - Production-grade code quality
   - Full functional requirements
   - Real user value for personal financial management
   - Modern architecture patterns
